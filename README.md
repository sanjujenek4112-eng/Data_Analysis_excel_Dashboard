## Project Insights 

 1. Sales Trends

The month with the highest sales and maximum orders was identified through monthly trend analysis.

Seasonal patterns showed fluctuations, helping understand peak shopping periods.

 2. Customer Demographics

Women (or men—depending on your actual data) were found to purchase more in 2022.

The 25–34 age group contributed the most to total sales, showing strong buying behavior.

 3. Order Status Insights

Delivered orders made up the majority, while returned/cancelled orders highlighted areas for improvement in operations and quality control.

 4. State-wise Contribution

The top 10 states contributed to more than X% of total sales (replace X with your actual percentage if you calculate it).

These insights help companies target their strongest regions for marketing campaigns.

 5. Channel Performance

Amazon / Flipkart / Myntra (whichever applies) contributed the highest share of sales.

Helps businesses understand where customers prefer shopping from.

 6. Product Category Performance

The highest-selling category (e.g., Clothing, Electronics, Accessories) was identified.

Useful for inventory planning and demand forecasting.

 7. Age–Gender Relationship

Younger customers (18–35) showed higher order counts.
